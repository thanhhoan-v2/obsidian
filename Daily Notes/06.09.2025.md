This is a dairy.

I have completed the first week of 2-month probation at TeamMint - The SMC Group. I worked from Wednesday to Friday (Mon and Tues are national holidays).

The work is fine, it's great. No pressures. No hard feelings. **Only energy is not reserving well**.

No LeetCode problem is solved. No System Design question is learned. No workout session is done.

I still have the energy the wash the dishes, but that's all. **I felt exhausted.**

At work, I'm NOT focusing on the core values: **time and energy**. _I just kept multi-tasking_, jumping back and forth. 
Not that I'm not doing the job, but I kept forgetting the core outcome. _I was distracted by the side details._

After this very first week, I know what I'm missing: 
- Focus on one task at a time.
	- *Leave the codebase better than you found it.*
	- *Sweat the details and get it right.* Pay attention on edge cases, focus on one task only but make it perfect.
- Workout more, sleep early.
- Drink less coffee, drink more water.
- Spend 15 minutes each day focusing on a LeetCode problem, read tech news, learn System Design.

I know that if my enery is delegating well, I can do alot of things, tackle alot of stuff, including things that may out of my comprehension.

But the most important thing is, **always know your aims.**
