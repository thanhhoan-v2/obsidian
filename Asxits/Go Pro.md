## How to grow

> https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/06/software-engineer-career/

- 3 factors that drive the personal growth of software engineers
  - Ambition: become a better version of yourself
  - Capacity: ability to perform tasks that are one-level-higher than your tasks, or ability to learn it quickly.
  - Opportunity || Luck: (Doing things) x (Telling people)

- _To broaden their influence_, software engineers can talk to their manager or to a superior peer.
  - See what they do and how they operate.
  - Try to take some tasks off their plate and do them yourself.
  - If you donâ€™t know how to do it, train that muscle and learn.
