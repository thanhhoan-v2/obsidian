## STAR Method
- **Situation**: Present basic details of the scenario, just enough to understand the challenge you were in. (Do not spend too much time on this)
- **Task**: What did you need to achieve or do in the scenario? (Do not spend too much time on this)
- **Action**: What did you do? This is where you exhibit required traits based on the approach you took to solve the challenge or situation.
- **Results**: What was the outcome of your actions?
#### Example
- Situation: In my current job as Front End Engineer in a startup, I was once in a situation where I had to deliver several important features for an e-commerce campaign at very short notice, since different teams were making feature requests at the time.
- Task: As I recognized that it was not possible for me to achieve all of them with good quality and also in a timely manner. I had to find a way to deconflict their priorities.
- Action: 
	- What I did was to arrange a quick meeting with all relevant product and engineering stakeholders to co-prioritize and assign the appropriate resources to support this project.
	- I listed the features requested from every team and worked with all the relevant stakeholders to identify each feature's contribution to business objectives, while also roughly estimating the engineering effort for each one.
	- This helped us to deprioritize features that had very high engineering effort but little contribution to the objectives.
	- For projects that were not realistically possible to achieve within the timelines, we were able to negotiate for more engineering resources to delegate these feature work to.
	- After that, to ensure my own timelines were met, I broke down my features into smaller tasks and planned them into daily and weekly milestones, reviewing my progress regularly with the team.
- Result: With this co-prioritization and planning effort, I was able to achieve all the required features by the stipulated timeline.

### Example

I graduated from Northeastern University in 2020 with a degree in Computer Science. My interests are in Front End development and I enjoy building delightful products on the web because of the freedom to develop whatever comes to mind and the fast feedback loop.

I took a web development course while in school which taught me the fundamentals of full stack development. With these skills, I managed to secure software engineering internships at companies like Uber and Palantir. At Uber, I built an internal tool to help developers manage their test rider and driver accounts using React, Redux, and GraphQL.

I'm interested in the Front End Engineer role at Google because I use Google products on a daily basis and am very impressed by their well thought out product experience. It'd be a dream come true to work on such products that impact the lives of billions.

## Problem-solving Questions

- Can you tell me about a time when you had to **use data to drive engineering decisions**?
- Can you provide an example of a time when you had to **troubleshoot and fix a complex issue** in a project?
- Can you describe a time you **creatively solved** an engineering problem or achieved meaningful metric improvement?
- Can you describe a time when you had to make an important engineering decision and how you decided **between tradeoffs**?

### Thinking process
1. **Problem identification**: Identifying the correct root cause or root problem to focus on from surface level symptoms
2. **Metrics/target setting**: Identify key metrics that would signify success in solving the problem (if any)
3. **Information gathering**: Resourcefulness in gathering information from different sources and a data-driven mindset (using data to drive decisions)
4. **Solution brainstorming**: Creatively generate solutions that solve the root cause
5. **Solution evaluation**: Evaluate trade-offs of each solution and select the most optimal one
6. **Monitoring and adjustment**: Monitor effectiveness of the solution by measuring key metrics. Adjust strategy if needed

-> Pick 1 of your _stories or projects_ that can serve to get signals on the following:
- **Proactivity/initiative-taking**: You had taken the initiative to look into the problem, gather information and solve it
- **Leadership**: You had led the problem solving process
- **Teamwork**: You had to work as part of a team to solve the problem

### Example
- **Situation**: I was the tech lead for an e-commerce website selling luxury goods. The website was built as an Angular 1.5 single-page application. In recent years, the product was showing its age – developer experience was not great and the website performance was poor. Initial loading speed was over 3 seconds and the conversion rate was around 0.8%.
- **Task**: I was tasked with improving the performance and conversion of the website.
- **Actions**
	- **Problem identification**: Conversion is tied to website performance and UX
	- **Information gathering**: Looked at nature of bugs in the past year, categorized them according to their root causes to identify hotspots and major problematic areas.
	- **Solution Brainstorming**: Server side rendering is crucial for its performance and SEO benefits. Made choices around good performance.
	- **Solution Evaluation**: Chose Next.js because it is backed by a company, there were many available resources, and has the largest community of all. React is also the most popular JavaScript library out there and also easiest to hire for
	- **Monitoring and adjustment**: Rolled out the new website behind an A/B test while monitoring the performance and conversion rates over a period of 2 months.
- **Results**: Lighthouse score improved to 92; Loading speed improved to 1.5 seconds

4. Describe the impact of said behaviors
5. Point it out as an opportunity for growth rather than a fault
6. Offer actionable suggestions

> Although there seem to be a large number of required traits, you can cover 90% of them with a very common situation that occurs in engineering teams:
> 	- You had to work within a cross-functional team (e.g. with business stakeholders or product managers or designers) on a high pressure situation, where priorities and requirements were changing rapidly
> 	- There's a conflict of interest between business/design and engineering, such as business/design pushing (demanding) for tighter deadlines, while from engineering perspective rushing for those deadlines will result in large tech debt
> 	- You had to provide constructive feedback to business/design on the problem
> 	- In so doing, you needed to convey technical concepts to the non-technical audience
> 	- Further, you solicited feedback from them to understand how engineering could collaborate better to avoid this problem again. In so doing, you regularly ran through the list of demands or requirements with them to see if any could be dropped for faster engineering delivery. Additionally, you catered for their need on timeline accountability by providing regular updates

### Example

#### Example using STAR

**Situation**
- In my current job as front end engineer in a startup, I had to lead development on a highly urgent marketing project, working cross functionally with marketing and design
- At some point, marketing had expected the feature to ship within the next week, but there was a significant roadblock from engineering due to dependencies on a partner API team whose deliverables were delayed due to recent departures of two senior members
- The situation had become heated as marketing did not understand the roadblocks engineering had faced

**Task**: I had to resolve the misunderstanding to ensure smooth working relationship between both teams

**Actions**
- In order to do so, I spoke to marketing privately and gave them time to clearly explain the urgency and concerns or misconceptions marketing might have towards engineering
- I then explained the role of the partner teams, focusing specifically on their impact on the feature as opposed to complex technical information
- In doing so, we were able to brainstorm different ways we could ship the feature even without the external dependencies
- In parallel, I also spoke to the partner team's manager on the importance of the project to the company and the possibility of reprioritizing their work to help unblock us
- Apart from that, I also solicited feedback on how engineering could better collaborate with marketing to avoid such misunderstandings in future

**Results**
- Due to the tight collaboration between engineering and marketing, we were able to ship the feature in a timely manner
- As marketing prioritized timelines and accountability, we started providing regular updates and discussed alternatives for every potential blocker
- With this, every feature was successfully and smoothly delivered there after

#### Examples 

How do you ensure that your message is understood and well-received by your audience?
> To ensure that my message is well understood, after explaining, I will provide a few examples to illustrate my points and also ask my audience a few questions to confirm their understanding. In a project I did a few months ago, I had to explain to the business team why and how an urgent feature had been delayed by external team API delays. To do so, I focused on the key takeaways that business needed — which was how the feature was impacted by such a delay, and utilized visual aids as well as used simple and clear language. I also gave examples while asking questions to ascertain their understanding of my explanation. This allowed the business team to understand the dependency well enough to brainstorm ways to deliver the feature even without the dependencies.

How do you approach working with teammates who are not meeting their deadlines or responsibilities?
> Once it is clear that their behaviors may constitute a concerning pattern, I would let them know in a timely manner. For instance, I had a teammate on a project who had missed on bug fix timelines regularly, and once it happened a number of times, I scheduled a private meeting with him to talk to them about it. I focused on framing the conversation as a growth opportunity for him on top of what is already appreciated about them, which was his knowledge and mentorship as a senior developer. Instead of describing a general behavior such as "being late", I mentioned the specific tickets that were missed and the impact that had occurred from missing them, as well as its effect on the morale of the team. I then offered a few solutions, such as enacting a new reminder bot within the channel for tickets that were due soon. He was able to understand where I was coming from and our team was able to meet our deadlines much better after that.

A good answer combines a consistent schedule and effort placed into learning, as well as how the learning was proactively applied to work. e.g. "I learned about X because I was doing Y. This impacted the way that I was tackling Z at work because it made me realize W and V".

The points below are key ideas you can structure your answer around technical learning; however, you should still add on concrete examples of events, newsletters or communities you have actually participated in, to showcase your willingness to keep up with trends.

### Examples

#### How do you stay up to date on the latest front end technologies and techniques?
 I have been working at a big tech company for the past two years now and the company uses a mix of external and internal technologies for our front end stack. Because we have a huge code base and established practice of doing things, we tend to not upgrade libraries that often and change our technology choices. It was only after a year into the job that I realized that I have been too comfortable in my role since I have fully ramped up on the code base and haven't learnt anything new for the past year. It was then that I decided that I have to be proactive in my learning in order to keep my skills sharp and relevant.
 
 The Front End ecosystem moves really fast and there's a joke that there's a new JavaScript library emerging every day. Thankfully the ecosystem is more stable compared to 2015/2016 when a new wave of front end tooling first emerged. To keep myself updated without suffering from JavaScript fatigue, I spend a weekend every month going through front end newsletters like "This Week in React" and "JavaScript Weekly" and reading engineering blogs. If I see something interesting or is relevant to my job, I will dive deeper into them by trying out small examples and building small prototypes in my company's code base. For example, I recently discovered React Query, which is a data fetching library for React that uses a declarative paradigm for fetching data and am trying to incorporate it into my work. I also recently discovered tRPC, a library that enforces type safety between client and server boundaries, which is an issue that has caused some bugs for us.
 
 To make this learning process more fun and collaborative, I started a front end social club within my company by creating a new Slack channel and inviting a few like-minded coworkers to join. Anyone can share front end news they find interesting there and discuss front end technologies. It has been pretty well-received, with over 30 people currently in the channel and activity nearly everyday. A side effect of this initiative is that people also start asking questions about front end issues they are facing at work, and we created another Slack channel for people to get help on front end issues. Feedback has been really positive so far!

-> This answer uses the STAR technique in a subtle fashion and demonstrates many qualities interviewers would like to see in candidates:
- **Passion**: Keen to learn more about front end domain
- **Growth**: Identified that the lack of growth would be a problem
- **Initiative**: Acted on the problem of lack of growth
- **Problem solving**: Thought of ways to solve the lack of growth, and executed on it
- **Building camaraderie**: Rallying like minded folks for a common cause
- **Helps improves others**: Created Slack channels for sharing knowledge and supporting others

#### Can you provide an example of a time when you had to adapt to a new technical environment or framework?
 When I joined my current company back in 2019, I was fresh out of college and had no experience with the front end stack that the company was using, which used React, Apollo, Styled Components, TypeScript for their front end stack and a Django + GraphQL back end. Back in college, I was mainly using Vue.js for front end development as it was the JavaScript framework of choice taught in the web development class and haven't used GraphQL before.
 
 It was definitely a huge learning curve for me at the start and I was really afraid of underperforming due to my unfamiliarity with the tech stack. Thankfully I had a mentor who gave me a lot of guidance on the tech stack and came up with a number of onboarding tasks which were progressively harder. I first spent a few days reading the documentation websites of the technologies and trying out the examples on their websites. I made it a point to understand the problems that these libraries were solving and how they were better than prior art because I think knowing that is important for fully appreciating the library and using the right tool for the right job. I also looked up some resources that compared Vue.js to React, as they were quite similar yet had some differences. That helped me to learn React faster (fully grasping React hooks still took me some time though). When I had time at nights or on weekends, I'd explore building small projects using these new technologies and also rebuild my personal blog using Gatsby because it used both React and GraphQL.
 
 Within two months, I felt like I had learnt so much and was comfortable with most of the code base. I could build full stack features without much guidance from my mentor. To help future new employees who might face the same onboarding challenge, I jotted down my learnings in our internal wiki along with links to the best resources for learning the topic. My manager appreciated the initiative and commended me for that. Today, it is part of our official engineering onboarding resource and I update it every once in a while. A few new joiners have also thanked me for sharing my knowledge in the wiki and making their onboarding process smoother.
 
-> Analysis of the answer:
- **Coachable**: Follows guidance/suggestions by the mentor
- **Problem solving**: Came up with a few ways to help themselves onboard faster
- **Initiative**: Initiative to start the wiki
- **Empathy**: See that others might face the same issues and started the wiki
- **Helps improves others**: New joiners benefit from the wiki
