- This day marks the beginning of the journey of becoming a "better me" version.

- After 5 years of college, I made myself a really bad version.

- Today, I finished reading the book "Manifest - 7 steps of changing your life forever". The book is here [[Manifest - Keynotes]].

- I have been recovering my mental health since the day I broke apart, after knowing I failed the interview at Viettel.
- I lost my confidence, will of learning everything, hope of becoming the best version of myself. I felt broken.
- I didn't know what to do. All the fantasies that I imagined after getting into Viettel keep haunting me.

- The failure of Viettel placed a fear on me of getting the next job, TalentGetGo.
- I feared that I will not succeed, feared that I will fail.

- My mind is poisoned with all the negativities I had since the day I moved away from college. I did not have the best experience with my family. 
- My mom and my dad keep telling me to workout, to practice speaking, since I have stuttering and body weight problems.

- I did not want to change.

- 10/08/2025, the day I had enough. After Dad told me to overcome the stuttering, I went straight to my friends for one night. That night changed me.
- The friend, told me to stay discipline, to be suffer is to gain. I already knew about that, just that I forgot since I entered college.

- Fuck. I have to change my life. Not because I followed the advice from the friend. Not because I against my family. It's because I know I need to change at some point.

- I searched and bought some books. I read alot, than 5 years of college. I wrote some stuff. I workout more. I eat less and healthier. 
- My mental health recovers, my mind is cleared. 
- I know how to handle failures.
- I know energy is important.
- I know being grateful is important.
