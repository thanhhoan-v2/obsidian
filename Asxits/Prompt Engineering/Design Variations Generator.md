Generate n = 3 files

## Instructions

Look at the design that has been attached.

Create 3 different versions of that same design. Make each one look different but keep the same basic idea and functionality.

Follow any additional instructions given in the prompt.

## File Management

1. Check if a "variations" folder exists
2. If it exists:

- Rename the reference design to "source.html"
- Delete any other files in the folder
- If "source.html" already exists, delete the old one first

4. If no "variations" folder exists:

- Create the "variations" folder
- Put the reference design in as "source.html"

## Create Files

Make these files in the variations folder:

- design-1.html
- design-2.html
- design-3.html
- Continue to design-{n}.html if more than 3 requested

Each design should be completely different visually but work the same way.

## That's it.

Keep it simple. Make them look different. Follow any extra instructions given.
