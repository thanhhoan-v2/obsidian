## Do this everyday

####  LeetCode

> The goal is to getting familiar with common patterns.

You probably pass most interviews.
>  If you can solve medium problems haven't seen before, within 20 minutes.

Why you can't solve hard problems?
>  Many of these problems were first solved by professional mathematicians in the past. You're not expected to easily figure these out on your own.

- Do 1 problem.
- Revise previous completed problem.

#### GreatFrontEnd

- Do a [Coding](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions) question. 
- Read - Understand - Anki a [System Design](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/system-design) question.

#### Write **brag document** "list of stuff I did"

- Write "What I have learnt"
- Write big sections like "Security" then write the works you've done. For each work:
	1. Explain your goal for the work (why do you think it’s important to refactor X piece of code?)
	2. List some things you’ve done towards that goal
	3. List any effects you’ve seen of the work, even if they’re a little indirect
- Notice the patterns (useful for behavioral interviews)
	- What work do I feel most proud of?
	- Are there themes in these projects I should be thinking about? What’s the big picture of what I’m working on? (am I working a lot on security? localization?).
	- What do I wish I was doing more / less of?
	- Which of my projects had the effect I wanted, and which didn’t? Why might that have been?
	- What could have gone better with project X? What might I want to do differently next time?
